	  This enables support for the RPi power domains which can be enabled
	  or disabled via the RPi firmware.

config SOC_BRCMSTB
	bool "Broadcom STB SoC drivers"

	select SOC_BUS
	help
	  Enables drivers for the Broadcom Set-Top Box (STB) series of chips.
	  This option alone enables only some support code, while the drivers
	  can be enabled individually within this menu.

	  If unsure, say N.

config BRCMSTB_BMEM
	bool "Enable BMEM reserved A/V memory"
	depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK && (ARCH_BRCMSTB || BMIPS_GENERIC)
	help
	  The A/V peripherals (managed by the PI/Nexus middleware) require
	  large, contiguous memory regions to be set aside at boot time.  This
	  option sets those up in a default config that reserves most of
	  memory.  Also allows the user to manually define region sizes and
	  locations using the 'bmem' command line param.  Allows for O_DIRECT
	  I/O using these regions, mmap() from user programs, and
	  ioremap() from kernel drivers.

	  If you are planning to use Broadcom middleware, choose Y here.
