	help
	  The A/V peripherals (managed by the PI/Nexus middleware) require
	  large, contiguous memory regions to be set aside at boot time.  This
	  option sets those up in a default config that reserves most of
	  memory.  Also allows the user to manually define region sizes and
	  locations using the 'bmem' command line param.  Allows for O_DIRECT
	  I/O using these regions, mmap() from user programs, and
	  ioremap() from kernel drivers.

	  If you are planning to use Broadcom middleware, choose Y here.

config BRCMSTB_SRPD
	tristate "Support enabling DDR self-refresh modes"
	help
	 Provides a sysfs interface for setting the self-refresh timeout
	 value on Broadcom STB memory controllers.
