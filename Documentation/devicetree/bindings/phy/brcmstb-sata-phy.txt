Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,brcmstb-sata-phy"
- reg: address and length of the register
- address-cells: should be 1
- size-cells: should be 0
- phy-cells: from the generic PHY bindings, must be 1
- ssc-enable: enabling SSC on port

Sub-nodes:
Each PHY should be represented as a sub-node.

Sub-nodes required properties:
- reg: the PHY number

Example:
	sata_phy0: phy@1800000 {
		compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-phy";
		reg = <0x180000 0x1000>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		#phy-cells = <1>;
		status = "disabled";

		sata-phy@0 {
			reg = <0>;
		};

		sata-phy@1 {
			reg = <1>;
		};
	};
