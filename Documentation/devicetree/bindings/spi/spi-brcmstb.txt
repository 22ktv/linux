* Broadcom STB SPI Controller (spi-brcmstb)

Required properties:
- compatible: "brcm,brcmstb-spi"
- reg: Base address and length of the register in the following order:
	- Host controller register map (required)
	- L1 interrupt register map (required)
- interrupts: The interrupt number to the cpu. The interrupt specifier format
  depends on the interrupt controller.

Required Board Specific Properties:
- #address-cells: should be 1.
- #size-cells: should be 0.

Optional Board Specific Properties:
- num-cs: Specifies the number of chip select lines supported. If
  not specified, the default number of chip select lines is set to 1.

SPI Controller specific data in SPI slave nodes:
- The spi slave nodes should provide the following information which is required
  by the spi controller.

Aliases:
- All the SPI controller nodes should be represented in the aliases node using
  the following format 'spi{n}' where n is a unique number for the alias.

Example:
	spi0: spi@413000 {
		compatible = "brcm,brcmstb-spi";
		reg = <0x413000 0x388>, <0x411d00 0x18>;
		interrupt-parent = <&periph_intc>;
		interrupts = <31>;
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <0>;
		status = "disabled";

		m25p80@0 {
			compatible = "m25p80";
			spi-max-frequency = <50000000>;
			reg = <0>;
			spi-cpha;
			spi-cpol;
		};
	};
